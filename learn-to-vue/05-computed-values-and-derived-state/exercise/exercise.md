# Exercise: Computed Values and Derived State

1. Recreate the focused example in a disposable Vue project.
2. Change the visible content and data while preserving the module rule.
3. Add the normal, empty, invalid, loading, or error state relevant to this lesson.
4. Test keyboard use and inspect the rendered DOM rather than checking appearance alone.
5. Explain which code owns state, external work, cleanup, and recovery.

## Success check

The project passes strict type checking and its behavior demonstrates this rule: A computed value derives information from reactive sources and should stay pure, cached by dependency, and free of mutation.
