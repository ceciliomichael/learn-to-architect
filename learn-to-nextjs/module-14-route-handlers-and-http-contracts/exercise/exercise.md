# Exercise: Route Handlers and HTTP Contracts

1. Recreate the focused example in a disposable Next.js project.
2. Change the visible content and data while preserving the module rule.
3. Add the normal, empty, invalid, loading, or error state relevant to this lesson.
4. Test keyboard use and inspect the rendered DOM rather than checking appearance alone.
5. Explain which code owns state, external work, cleanup, and recovery.

## Success check

The project passes strict type checking and its behavior demonstrates this rule: A route handler implements an HTTP contract with Web Request and Response APIs. Parse input, validate it, enforce access, choose status codes, and return a stable response shape.
