# Exercise: Server Functions, Server Actions, and Mutations

1. Recreate the focused example in a disposable Next.js project.
2. Change the visible content and data while preserving the module rule.
3. Add the normal, empty, invalid, loading, or error state relevant to this lesson.
4. Test keyboard use and inspect the rendered DOM rather than checking appearance alone.
5. Explain which code owns state, external work, cleanup, and recovery.

## Success check

The project passes strict type checking and its behavior demonstrates this rule: A server function runs trusted server code, and a server action can be invoked as a mutation endpoint from the UI. Validate input and authenticate and authorize every call.
