# Exercise: Server and Client Component Boundaries

1. Recreate the focused example in a disposable Next.js project.
2. Change the visible content and data while preserving the module rule.
3. Add the normal, empty, invalid, loading, or error state relevant to this lesson.
4. Test keyboard use and inspect the rendered DOM rather than checking appearance alone.
5. Explain which code owns state, external work, cleanup, and recovery.

## Success check

The project passes strict type checking and its behavior demonstrates this rule: Components in the App Router are Server Components unless a client boundary is declared. Add use client only where browser state, effects, event handlers, or browser APIs are required.
