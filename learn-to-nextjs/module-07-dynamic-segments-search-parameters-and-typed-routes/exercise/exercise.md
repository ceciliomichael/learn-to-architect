# Exercise: Dynamic Segments, Search Parameters, and Typed Routes

1. Recreate the focused example in a disposable Next.js project.
2. Change the visible content and data while preserving the module rule.
3. Add the normal, empty, invalid, loading, or error state relevant to this lesson.
4. Test keyboard use and inspect the rendered DOM rather than checking appearance alone.
5. Explain which code owns state, external work, cleanup, and recovery.

## Success check

The project passes strict type checking and its behavior demonstrates this rule: Dynamic segment folders capture path values, search parameters represent query values, and both remain untrusted input even when TypeScript describes their shape.
